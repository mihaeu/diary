# Diary

This is the setup I use for writing and publishing my diaries as books.

The files are in a separate place (e.g. Dropbox) in markdown format and will be converted to monthly entries fitting the Easybook generator.

Multiple diaries can be configured.

_This was not intended for public use, but I guess it can't hurt to share the way I did it._
